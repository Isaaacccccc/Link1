##Value Proposition 

The mobile application distinguishes itself by an essential feature that sets it apart from other current proposals, as it brings together the most prominent functions in the market in one place: an application that offers two service modes, one for deaf people who cannot read and another for those who can. This functionality is highly valuable since it is commonly found that most apps in the current market are not fully inclusive and exclusively focus on deaf individuals who can read, leaving aside those who cannot. It is for this reason that we consider it important to provide support to both sectors through inclusive features such as interaction via images (for those who cannot read) or text, assistance through images that produce key sounds, contact with emergency numbers or nearby individuals (family, friends) in emergency situations, and support tutorials on how to use the application.
