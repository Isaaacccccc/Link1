## This document will explain the main requirements for the *FacReviewer* project.


Before starting, the project will be briefly introduced, highlighting the main ideas that we have formulated for the integration of the interface and the main functionalities of the project.

 - It will have an interface in which you will be able to see the different faculties, by clicking on them you will be able to see the careers and select the one in which you want to see the opinions.
 - It is proposed to add to the mentors that they can express their ideas about the careers, this will be done through a visualization where different comments will be highlighted.
 - The service should be visualized through a web page, where users can register to be able to add their comments or save the most important ones and even chat in a certain way with other colleagues.
 
 Below is the list of functional and non-functional requirements for the app.
 
| Non-functional requirements | Functional requirements |
|--|--|
| Management and maintenance of respect on the page by means of a bot that can detect aggressive ideas or a moderator on the page. | Users who function as mentors or who can implement their critiques or thoughts on careers.|
| 24/7 availability. Users will be able to access the system whenever they want, so they will be able to view all reviews and comment at any time. |Account creation. Students must create an account to access the service by providing academic data. |

This is a short list of those features we are interested in and have planned for the moment, more may be added as the file is generated and the project documentation is developed. The present ones, for the moment, reflect an early version of the interface and sketches we have idealized for the application.
